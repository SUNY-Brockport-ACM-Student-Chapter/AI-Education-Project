As a single parent, Cherith has more responsibility with her children than she would if she were married and had a spouse or partner with whom to share day-to-day responsibilities., 3.High levels of fatigue – The high levels of care and supervision her children require might result in Cherith feeling fatigued. Additionally, she might be losing sleep if one of the children is not sleeping., 4. Financial burdens – Cherith’s twins receive multiple services and supports outside the home and school (e.g., medical, therapies). These services and supports are expensive and not covered in full by insurance or other programs. The cost of gas getting to and from therapies can add up as well., 5.

        "    \"question\" : \"Recall Jaquese from the Challenge. Jaquese is a ten-year-old student in an inclusive fourth- grade classroom. Jaquese loves mathematics and science and is above grade level in both subjects. Because of this, his teachers have a hard time keeping him engaged during mathematics and science instruction. On the other hand, Jaquese has difficulty with reading and writing. He also struggles with reading comprehension, both when a story is read to him and when he reads it independently. He’s obsessed with superheroes and will often quote and act out scenes from their comic books or films. This is often frustrating for the teacher, because no matter how she tries to distract him from his imaginary superheroes, he always comes back to them. In fact, he often cannot begin his work until he has finished acting out an entire scene. Further, most students do not understand his obsession; they find Jaquese annoying and do their best to avoid him. Imagine you are Jaquese’s general education teacher. Using what you know about Jaquese, select three strategies discussed in this module that you could implement to increase his success in the classroom. Explain why you chose each and how it will benefit him.\",\n",
